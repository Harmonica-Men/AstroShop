### Front Page Overview
The **Front Page** is designed to give a quick overview of a list of 5 blog posts ranked by the date added, with the most recent post at the top of the page.

1. **NavBar**: The 'navbar' has a dual function and can be used by both visitors and authenticated users.
   - **For Visitors & Users**: can quickly navigate back to the "homepage" by clicking the home icon or to the 'front page blog posts' by clicking the left arrow icon.
   - **For Visitors**: Visitors can always read posts but cannot participate. They have the option to view posts by category or to join Astro Share Blog by registering.
   - **For Users**: Users have full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for their own posts. The 'Add Post' option appears, and they see 'Logged in as,' giving them the ability to change their profile settings and details.

2. **Blog Post Snippets**: Each blog post is presented as a snippet along with a corresponding image.
   - **For Visitors**: The `[read more]` link redirects to the article detail page where the full post can be read.
   - **For Users**: Users have the same functionality as visitors, but on the redirected page, they have full control over their posts.

3. **Detailed Article Posts**: On this page, each post is treated individually.
   - **For Visitors**: Visitors can read the full blog post and any comments (if available). They cannot like or comment on posts. Visitors can click on the author's name to view the author’s profile page.
   - **For Users**: Users can read the post, comment, and 'Like' the posts. They can only 'Dislike' posts they have already liked.  
     The option to dislike posts outright is not part of the blog’s policy.

### Mobile first design
To ensure a seamless experience across devices, Bootstrap is used to make the Home- & Frontpage fully responsive. On mobile devices, the table features horizontal scrolling to prevent content compression, maintaining clarity and usability. Additionally, each table row highlights with a colour change on hover, making it easier for users to track their interactions as they navigate.

## Bootstrap themes

I choose to make life easier to use a (free) bootstap template from https://startbootstrap.com/template/shop-homepage
this theme i espiaclly designed for Ecommerce apllications.

It delivers the template file you can customize afterwords whit default ccs, js ,index page en asset folder for favicon.

It's recommend to use a front-end bootstrap template, so that easier to start the project and dive in to core application of Django.

This color palette was chosen not only for its visual appeal but also for its contribution to a cohesive and user-friendly interface, reinforcing the professional and serious tone of the application.

### Color Customization Process

The colour customization process in this project was designed to offer flexibility and personalisation. I have implemented a series of **CSS Variables** to define various colour palettes.

Key elements of the colour customization process include:

- **Multiple Colour Palettes**: I have created several distinct colour palettes, each with its unique style—ranging from more traditional to modern and alternative designs. The default palette, known as the **root palette**, is the primary theme that all users see upon first visiting the site.

- **CSS Variables**: The different colour palettes are implemented using CSS Variables, which allows for dynamic and flexible styling of various elements across the site. This ensures a consistent and responsive design while providing a personalised experience for each user.

### Fonts

I used a combination of classic and modern fonts to diversify myself, I've integrated [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to find a typeface that complements the website's aesthetic. For the main text, I've opted for [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/?query=+Montserrat "Montserrat") due to its classic appearance. Its make it easy to read long sentences.
