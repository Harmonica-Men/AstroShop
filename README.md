## Development Tools

- **Bootstrap:** Bootstrap is a popular front-end development framework that helps developers create responsive, mobile-first websites quickly and efficiently. It provides a collection of pre-designed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components like buttons, forms, navigation bars, and grid layouts. By using Bootstrap, developers can build modern, visually consistent web pages without writing extensive custom code. It's widely appreciated for its ease of use, customization options, and ability to adapt to various screen sizes, making it a go-to tool for fast web development.
- **Modular Design:** Modular design is a system design approach that divides a system into independent, interchangeable modules. Each module performs a specific function, enabling flexibility, easy maintenance, scalability, and reusability.
- **Consistent Aesthetic:** To maintaining a unified and cohesive visual style across all elements of a design. This includes consistent use of colors, fonts, shapes, and layout, ensuring that all components appear harmonious. It enhances user experience by creating familiarity and brand identity, making designs more professional and visually appealing.

## CSS Management for Project Structure

In my project, I decided to use a single CSS file, styles.css, to manage all the styling across the application.
These variables are defined within styles.css, and ensuring they work correctly is crucial for applying themes consistently across the site.

By consolidating all the styles into one file, I make managing themes straightforward. If I need to switch themes or make adjustments, I only need to modify this single CSS file, which allows for a seamless transition to a new look and feel across the entire application. This approach not only simplifies maintenance but also reinforces my focus on code reuse and consistency.

Additionally, having a single CSS file helps me avoid complications related to injecting styles through Bootstrap, ensuring that the CSS variables function as intended throughout the application.


### Index Page Overview

The homepage starts with a 'hero section' featuring an embedded video stream in replay, along with a parallax effect designed to captivate visitors. This section offers users the option to engage with the Blog Post.

Following this, the AstroBlog section provides a brief introduction to the purpose of the site, helping visitors quickly understand what the site is about.

To build more interest, I have incorporated an 'Astronomy Picture of the Day' (APOD) section where users and visitors always have a new astronomical item to explore, providing an easy and quick overview of the latest posts.

In a zigzag pattern, the most popular categories are displayed on the homepage. To encourage further engagement with the blog, a 'Latest Contributors' section is also included.

For astronomical enthusiasts, a nice widget is incorporated that tracks the current position of the International Space Station (ISS). When clicking on the 'Go To the ISS' button, a new page appears with an independently generated world map showing the ISS’s location.

At the bottom of the page, I have included a subscription section where users can join the mailing list to receive newsletters, information, and relevant benefits.

Finally, the page concludes with a footer that reinforces credibility and includes essential links, such as the social media links for the blog.

### Front Page Overview
The **Front Page** is designed to give a quick overview of a list of 5 blog posts ranked by the date added, with the most recent post at the top of the page.

1. **NavBar**: The 'navbar' has a dual function and can be used by both visitors and authenticated users.
   - **For Visitors & Users**: can quickly navigate back to the "homepage" by clicking the home icon or to the 'front page blog posts' by clicking the left arrow icon.
   - **For Visitors**: Visitors can always read posts but cannot participate. They have the option to view posts by category or to join Astro Share Blog by registering.
   - **For Users**: Users have full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for their own posts. The 'Add Post' option appears, and they see 'Logged in as,' giving them the ability to change their profile settings and details.

2. **Blog Post Snippets**: Each blog post is presented as a snippet along with a corresponding image.
   - **For Visitors**: The `[read more]` link redirects to the article detail page where the full post can be read.
   - **For Users**: Users have the same functionality as visitors, but on the redirected page, they have full control over their posts.

3. **Detailed Article Posts**: On this page, each post is treated individually.
   - **For Visitors**: Visitors can read the full blog post and any comments (if available). They cannot like or comment on posts. Visitors can click on the author's name to view the author’s profile page.
   - **For Users**: Users can read the post, comment, and 'Like' the posts. They can only 'Dislike' posts they have already liked.  
     The option to dislike posts outright is not part of the blog’s policy.

### Mobile first design
To ensure a seamless experience across devices, Bootstrap is used to make the Home- & Frontpage fully responsive. On mobile devices, the table features horizontal scrolling to prevent content compression, maintaining clarity and usability. Additionally, each table row highlights with a colour change on hover, making it easier for users to track their interactions as they navigate.

## Colors

The color palette for this project has been carefully selected to ensure a professional and clean aesthetic, aligning with the brand identity and enhancing user experience. Below is a breakdown of the primary colors used across the application:

![Color Palette](static/images/readme-images/colorpalette.webp)

As for colors I decided to use Color-Hunt. https://colorhunt.co

- **Primary Color:** `#222831` -  is a dark charcoal gray with subtle blue-green undertones, perfect for sleek and modern designs.
- <img src="static/images/readme-images/222831.webp" width="500px" height="50px">


- **Secondary Color:** `#393E46` - (also atrribute color) s a dark plum or eggplant shade with a mix of deep purple and gray tones, ideal for rich and moody designs.
- <img src="static/images/readme-images/393E46.webp" width="500px" height="50px">


- **Primary Color Highlight:** `#222831` - is a vibrant teal with cool blue and green tones, evoking a fresh, modern, and energetic feel.
- <img src="static/images/readme-images/222831.webp" width="500px" height="50px">


- **Background Color:** `#EEEEEE` - is a very light gray, almost white, offering a clean, soft, and neutral appearance.
- <img src="static/images/readme-images/EEEEEE.webp" width="500px" height="50px">


- **Accent Color:** `#00ADB5` - is a vibrant teal with cool blue and green tones, evoking a fresh, modern, and energetic feel.

- <img src="static/images/readme-images/00ADB5.webp" width="500px" height="50px">


- **Main Text Color:** `#FFFFFF` - Tis pure white, the brightest and most neutral color, representing simplicity, cleanliness, and clarity.
- <img src="static/images/readme-images/FFFFFF.webp" width="500px" height="50px">
- **Secondary Text Color:** `#000000` - (--main-text-color-invers) Is pure black, the darkest color, symbolizing elegance, power, and sophistication.
- <img src="static/images/readme-images/000000.webp" width="500px" height="50px">


- **Highlight Hover Color:** `#FFC400` -  is a bold, vibrant yellow-gold, exuding warmth, energy, and a sense of luxury.
- <img src="static/images/readme-images/FFC400.webp" width="500px" height="50px">


- **Dark Text Shadow:** `2px 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)` - A bolder text shadow used on white backgrounds, ensuring 
that text stands out clearly.
- <img src="static/images/readme-images/000005.webp" width="500px" height="50px">


### Color Customization Process

The colour customization process in this project was designed to offer flexibility and personalisation. I have implemented a series of **CSS Variables** to define various colour palettes.

Key elements of the colour customization process include:

- **Multiple Colour Palettes**: I have created several distinct colour palettes, each with its unique style—ranging from more traditional to modern and alternative designs. The default palette, known as the **root palette**, is the primary theme that all users see upon first visiting the site.

- **CSS Variables**: The different colour palettes are implemented using CSS Variables, which allows for dynamic and flexible styling of various elements across the site. This ensures a consistent and responsive design while providing a personalised experience for each user.

### Fonts - Typography

I used a combination of classic and modern fonts to diversify myself, I've integrated [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to find a typeface that complements the website's aesthetic. For the main text, I've opted for [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?query=Lato/ "Lato") due to its classic appearance. Its make it easy to read long sentences.

![Lato Font](static/images/readme-images/lato-font.png)

To ensure accessibility and functionality across all devices and browsers, I included a fallback font stack. If Lato is unavailable, the design defaults to a generic sans-serif font, maintaining readability and visual appeal.

### Icons

As for icons and officious reason [Bootstrap Icons](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/extend/icons/ "Bootstrap Icons").

## Technologies Used

### Wireframes

The wireframes for this project served as a crucial guide during the development process, essentially acting as a blueprint for the design and layout of the website. My focus was primarily on two key pages: the index (or homepage) and the frontpage blog post. Given the repetitive nature of the blog post, I decided that it was a better idea to separate the homepage and the frontpage. The homepage serves more as an introductory page, while the frontpage blog post is a more active working page for the blog posts.

I chose to highlight only two wireframes in this README as they are the most critical to the overall user experience. Other pages did not require such detailed wireframing and followed more standard, basic templates.

### Wireframes for Homepage & Frontpage

**User and PaymentOfPayPal**:
  - Each user can have multiple PayPal payment methods, represented in the `PaymentOfPayPal` table. The `user_paypal` field in  `PaymentOfPayPal` links to the id `id` of the `User` table (one-to-many relationship).

**User and ShippingAddress**
  - Each user can have multiple shipping addresses. The `user` field in the `ShippingAddress` table refers to the `id` of the `User` table (one-to-many relationship).

**User and Order**
  - Each order is associated with a specific user. The `user` field in the `Order` table links to the `id` of the `User` table (one-to-many relationship).

**Order and OrderItem**
  - Each order can contain multiple items. The `order` field in `OrderItem` refers to the `id` of the `Order` table (one-to-many relationship).

**Product and OrderItem**
  - Each order item represents a specific product. The `product` field in `OrderItem` connects to the id `id` of the `Product` table (many-to-one relationship).

**User and OrderItem**
  - Each order item also tracks the user who purchased it. The user `git clone`field in `OrderItem` links to the `id` of the `User` table (many-to-one relationship).

**User and Profile**
  - Each user can have one profile. The `user` field in the `Profile` table refers to the `id` of the `User` table (one-to-one relationship).

**Category and Product**
  - Each product belongs to one category `category`. The category `category` field in the `Product` table links to the `id` of the `Category` table (many-to-one relationship).

## Testing

### HTML Validation

All pages have been passed through the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) successfully save for a few minor issues which have been left 'as is' as attempts to correct them proved unsuccessful and lead to results which devalued the user experience. Specifically, these were:

I ensured that the HTML structure of AstroBlog adheres strictly to web standards. I utilized the W3C Validator to validate our HTML code, striving to minimize and eliminate all possible errors. There are many templates to consider but the main pages where is the focus of stite are the Homepage and the Frontpaga-Blogpost.
After experimenting whit different container layout and fixing all the issues validation results showed **zero errors**.

### Accessibility

Ensuring accessibility is a key priority for AstroBlog. We've taken great care to make sure our platform is inclusive and usable by as many people as possible, regardless of their abilities or the devices they are using.

Throughout the development process, we adhered to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to guarantee that our site meets accessibility standards. This includes:

- **Proper use of ARIA attributes:** We have utilized ARIA attributes effectively to enhance the accessibility of dynamic content and interactive elements, ensuring screen readers can accurately convey the information to users.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements, including forms, buttons, and navigation links, are fully accessible via keyboard navigation, making the site usable without a mouse.
- **Contrast Ratios:** We carefully selected our color scheme to ensure sufficient contrast between text and background colors, making the content readable for users with visual impairments.
- **Alt Text for Images:** All images include descriptive `alt` attributes, providing context to users who rely on screen readers.

These efforts help ensure that our site is not only compliant with accessibility standards but also provides an inclusive user experience. We continue to monitor and improve the accessibility of astroblog as we develop new features and enhancements.

### Wave Validation

I have conducted a thorough accessibility audit using the WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool). There is a smooth transition between the header of the page and the rest of the main page. Nevertheless, there are some issues to address due to the background MPEG replay. WAVE is dynamic and cannot make a persistent measurement of background contrast.

<br>

I have also identified contrast issues with the modal buttons, which follow a similar color pattern to the Flash Danger alerts. However, the inclusion of shadow effects and other design enhancements significantly aids visibility. I believe these design choices ensure the buttons remain accessible and visually clear, even if they do not fully meet WAVE’s contrast recommendations.

Overall, the WAVE validation confirms that our website adheres to accessibility standards, with only a few minor contrast issues that have been carefully considered in the design process. While I will continue exploring potential solutions to these issues, I have prioritized maintaining a visually cohesive and intuitive theme for the site.

### Lighthouse Validation

My Lighthouse validation results have been very promising, with high scores across most categories. One area where I noticed a slightly lower score is in SEO, and I’m actively working on improvements to achieve even better results. Lighthouse has been instrumental in helping me organize my files and optimize for performance.

A specific recommendation from Lighthouse was to use the WebP format for images to improve load times. In response, I made sure that all images served through the browser are now in WebP format. However, I also understand that too much compression could negatively impact the user experience, especially on larger screens. So, I made a conscious decision to balance performance with visual quality. After gathering feedback from a diverse group of users, I confirmed that the image quality is well-received across various devices. As a result, I decided to maintain slightly larger image sizes to prioritize a smooth and visually appealing experience, even if it means sacrificing a little bit of performance.

Additionally, Lighthouse suggested reducing the CSS payload, which I’m currently considering. One option I’m exploring is breaking the main styles.css file into smaller files tied to specific widgets. This would allow me to send only the necessary CSS for each page, potentially cutting down the overall size of the CSS file and improving load times.

While the desktop version scores are very high, the mobile version, although still passing, has some room for improvement. I’m committed to refining these areas to ensure the best possible experience across all devices.

### JSHint Validation

Although my project doesn't include an extensive amount of JavaScript, I can ensured that the code we do have is fully validated using [**JSHint**](https://jshint.com/). I'm pleased to report that my JavaScript code has passed the validation process with a 99% clean bill of health—no errors whatsoever.

There is only one warning that issue has probably to do JSHint interpreter itself.

### Device Testing

The website has undergone thorough testing across a variety of devices, including desktop computers, tablets, and smartphones. We focused on ensuring that the responsiveness of the site is consistent and effective across all screen sizes, providing an optimal user experience regardless of the device used.

To achieve this, we employed media queries to adapt the layout for different screen sizes. This approach ensures that when the device's dimensions fall within specific ranges, certain elements will reposition themselves, maintaining readability and proper alignment. 

For instance, on smaller screens, such as smartphones, we adjusted the distribution of content to ensure that all elements are easily accessible and clearly visible, avoiding any overlap or readability issues. The result is a fluid and intuitive experience across devices, meeting our goal of a responsive design that performs well on all tested platforms.

## Bugs & Fixes

- In order to properly work with the NASA APOD API, I was unable to hide the API KEY from *views.py* (line 266) and the JavaScript (line 6). After extensive debugging, I was forced to hardcode the API KEY into the code.
- The issues I struggled with were how to enforce the JavaScript onto a JSON response fetch, which was too complicated.
- After that, I also had problems recalling the `NASA_API_KEY` from *settings.py*.
- For demonstrational purposes, I hardcoded the API KEYS to show the potential of the APIs.
- Further more in the newsletter subscription there should be a confirmation message displayed but was included but fail to render. Instead a 404 page was returned.
