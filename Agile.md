## Introduction

Agile planning methodology was used to create the site Astro Shop. GitHub projects was used to organise the development process into sprints, epics, Kanban boards and issues. This was the first time I have undertaken a project that was driven by the agile development process and a learning curve was associated with the development of this project, however the benefits of an agile approach soon outweighed the learning curve associated. I first started by creating issues. These where user stories that had a detailed acceptance criteria and unit tasks associated with each issue. These issues where also labelled using the MoSCoW technique. Each issue was then sorted into the epic in which it belonged. This project was completed over five Milestones of work.

## Benefits of agile development

As mentioned in the introduction there was a learning curve associated with using agile development for the first time, however there was a received number of benefits associated as well. These benefits include:

 1. Having a plan in place. It was easier to know which task I was working on and found myself getting less distracted as I was carrying out the work associated with the project.
 2. Having a dedicated timeframe for issues to be done. This helped me stay on track in terms of timeframe for the project.
 3. Initial overall planning of the project. As a lot of thought went into the user stories I was able to have a better picture of the overall project before starting the work. This sped up production and definitely felt more organised.
 4. Easily see the benefits of collaboration. As I was working on this project on my own it was easy to see how the use of agile would benefit collaboration if multiple people where working on a project together. Especially with the Kanban board, being able to see what is being worked on and the status of the work and also being able to assign this work to individual developers.

## MoSCoW

MoSCoW analysis helps developers understand which tasks to prioritise. It is a process by which labels are added to issues. These labels include 'Must-have', 'Could-have', 'Should-have' and ' Wont-have'. In my project I tried to ensure 'Should-have' prioritised user stories was not more than 60% of total. On reflection I should have prioritised more 'Must-have'. I also did not use 'Wont-have' and 'Could-have' in this project and this is something I would considering using more of in future projects as I found this technique useful to determine important work to be carried out. The image below shows a portion of the issues associated with this project and their labels in place.

## Milestones 

The project was divided into three milestones, each containing the corresponding epics and user stories: [Milestone in Projects](https://github.com/Harmonica-Men/AstroShare-Blog/milestones)
<br>

1. [Setting Up The Project @ Bear minimums](https://github.com/Harmonica-Men/AstroShop/issues/18)
- Task: The goal is to set up the project at its bare minimum.
  - EPIC 0 (Repository and Deploy Early)

2. [Basic Blog Functionality](https://github.com/Harmonica-Men/AstroShop/milestone/3)
- Task: Implement basic blog functionality including models, views, and templates.
  - EPIC 1 (Viewing and Navigation)

3. [Testing and Validation](https://github.com/Harmonica-Men/AstroShop/milestone/2)
- Task: test & validate
  - EPIC 5 (Testing and Validations) 

## User Stories and Epics

Astro Blog Share is for those who are interested in Astronomical subjects and like to share there toughs in a deticated blog. The blog can be used as a discussion platform for anybody who have a special affliation whit astronomy.

A user story is an explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user. Its purpose is to articulate how a software feature will provide value to the customer. User stories were created with the help of GitHub issues. Each user story contains:
* Title - Short description of the user story. 
* Description - As a **role** i can **capability** so that **received benefit**.
* Acceptance criteria - A set of conditions that a feature must meet to be accepted by the user. 
* Unit tasks - A break down of each task needed to complete user story. 
* A MoSCoW label - To prioritise tasks. 
* Assignee -  Who the user store is assigned too. 
* Milestone - Which epic this user store is associated with.
<br/>

I used an Agile methodology approach to plan this project. This was implemented through the GitHub Project board with milestones, epics, user stories and tasks.
Each user story was classified with a label according to MoSCoW prioritization.
